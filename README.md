OneDark++ / OneLight++
======================

This is the One theme from Atom, same colors and everything.
But is more consistent, when compared to other extensions.

This extension comes with 2 themes, a dark and a light version.

The dark version is a ported Atom One Dark theme that has the same colors, but in a different combination and is more consistent across languages.

The light version is ported from the dark version and has more lighter colors.


The light version is new and is under construction, so its not finished yet.
